# Canvas practice

I have created this static website in order to show what I've learnt so far using HTML5 canvas.

## Recognition

You can create cool canvas animations too, just by following @christopher4lis youtube tutorials!

Canvas Boilerplate is the go-to solution for quickly creating modern canvas pieces using ES6 and webpack.

## Getting Started With a Boilerplate!

1.  Clone the repo for boilerplate if you'd like to create your own:

        git clone https://github.com/christopher4lis/canvas-boilerplate.git

2.  Install dependencies:

        yarn

    or

        npm install

3.  Run webpack:

        npm start

Your canvas piece should open up automatically at http://localhost:3000 and you should see 'HTML CANVAS BOILERPLATE' on hover.
